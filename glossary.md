Architectural Scale: It is the relationship between the dimensions drawn on a plan or
architectural drawing and the actual dimensions of the building. Architectural pro-
jects are usually represented on a reduced scale to allow for an overview while main-
taining accuracy in details. The scale is indicated within the drawing by a division (e.g.,
1:100; each unit on the drawing represents 100 actual units).

Large Architectural Scale:
A large architectural scale refers to projects or representations where the dimensions
of a building or structure are depicted with a high level of detail, with a ratio closer to
the actual scale (e.g., 1:20).

Small Architectural Scale: A small architectural scale refers
to the representation of a project or building in which the ratio between the drawing
size and the real size is very small (e.g., 1:10,000). This scale is commonly used in urban
planning and territorial planning.

Attachments: Any additional documentation provided to better understand the orig-
inal documents may include photos, videos, or any other type of file. However, they
cannot, of course, be original resources downloadable from another node or within
the node itself.

Blueprint: The term refers to detailed technical drawings used as the definitive guide
for the realization of a project, such as a building.

Collateral Consequence: This type of connection between nodes occurs whenever a
node has an unforeseen impact that leads to the creation of a document or action. For
instance, the Expression of Interest influenced the Municipality's decision on where
to relocate the city, which was formalized through the Agreement of the Municipal
Board on City Relocation.

Concept: A type of drawing that can take forms such as a plan or section that are not
necessarily drawn to scale. This type of representation, used in the early stages of a
project, is useful for communicating design ideas visually and intuitively, without the
constraints of actual dimensions.

Detail Plan: Of the three planning tools available to Swedish municipalities, this one
has the largest scale. It determines land use and is the only one of the three types of
plans in the Swedish system to be mandatory. It always consists of two documents: a
plan that defines land use and a written text that explains what led to the drafting of
the plan with these characteristics.

Diagram (User interface): The Diagram is essentially the visualization of all the doc-
uments, negotiations, and material effects that have had or will have an impact on
the form of the emerging city, namely the new Kiruna, and the city that is dying: the
old town center. The diagram aims to depict the phenomenon of Kiruna's relocation.
The diagram organizes the nodes on a Cartesian plane where the horizontal axis rep-
resents time, and the vertical axis represents scale, understood both as architectural
scale and as proximity to achieving the goal, namely the construction of the architec-
tural artifact.

Direct Consequence: Direct consequence is the most common type of connection
between nodes and appears whenever a document explicitly anticipates the creation
of another document or subsequent action. An example is the connection between
"A New City Centre for Kiruna: Invite to an Architecture Competition" and the First
Delivery.

Document (Action)(Node): The Documents are the nodes of the diagram. They rep-
resent the agreements, conflicts, consultations, material effects, and documents that
directly influence the relocation process of Kiruna. Each of them is connected to a
specific internal area within the municipality of Kiruna.

Informative Documents: This type of documents aims to communicate, indirectly af-
fecting the urban space by enabling interaction between stakeholders, such as the
Invitation to Architecture Competition, New City Hall in Kiruna.

LKAB (Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB): It is the Swedish mining company operating in
Kiruna, state-owned and founded in 1890. It is one of the largest global producers of
iron ore, with operations mainly concentrated in northern Sweden.

Material Effects: It is a type of node present in the diagram representing the three
activities that are shaping the new city: demolition, reconstruction, and relocation.

Nodes: Nodes are elements of the diagram, each of which represents a document.
The various nodes are connected to each other by one or more connections.

Original Resources: Original resources are the original items or documents, which
could consist of multiple files, for example, a map and a text document of a ruling. For
example, the original resources of the detailed plans for Kiruna from 2004 onwards al-
ways consist of two PDF files: one contains a plan that defines land use, and the other
consists of a written text that explains the reasoning behind the drafting of the plan
with these characteristics.

Projection: This is a type of connection between nodes that is similar to a direct con-
sequence, but the generating document (or more commonly, the material effect)
precedes the resulting document. An example of this is the Mail to Kiruna Kommun,
written in anticipation of the full exploitation of Level 1365, which would only occur 12
years later.

Prescriptive Document: The prescriptive document is characterized by its authority;
these documents grant legal force to design-related documents, as they are issued by
a governing body, such as the detailed plans of the Municipality of Kiruna.

Resident (User2): The Residents of the municipality of Kiruna.

Urban Developer (User4): A figure involved in the construction process of the new
city. Urban Developers are part of companies that invest in real estate in Kiruna, pur-
chasing land to construct buildings on it, which they will then sell or, more rarely,
economically exploit to achieve a financial return. These figures are essential for the
development of Nya Kiruna.

Urban Planner (User1): The Urban Planner is an employee of the municipality of Kiru-
na, often a professional architect or urban planner, who is responsible for municipal
land-use planning. His main task is the preparation of detailed plans.

Update: This type of node connection, which, as the name suggests, simply connects
two documents that perform the same function but succeed each other over time,
like the various deformation forecasts.

Visitor (User3): An umbrella term that includes everyone from casual tourists and cu-
rious onlookers to scholars studying the relocation process of Kiruna.
